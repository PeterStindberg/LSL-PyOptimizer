# LSL PyOptimizer

**LSL PyOptimizer** is a LSL2 script optimizer written in Python 2. Currently it only supports code memory optimization (no speed optimization), only for Mono (no LSO or Luau), and only for the Second Life flavour of LSL (no OpenSim etc.).

> :warning: WARNING: \
This optimizer is designed for Mono only. It was never designed for LSO, and it was never designed for Luau. Some optimizations are known to make LSO and Luau code larger instead of shorter. When Luau becomes the default, this optimizer will become obsolete.
